# AvatarChange
An avatar changer in the style of Windows Vista - Windows 7 because ms broke it in win8+ :sad:

## ToDo-list
- make it actually render the current user picture, username, user type and check if the account is password protected
- make it so it actually changes the profile picture
- make it integrated to usercpl.dll.mun
- fix some bugs (selection is wierd)
